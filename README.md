[Play the game !](http://froggies.github.io/game-off-2013/)

### GAME's PHILOSOPHY

But actually, this game is not just a simple game. It's used to demonstrate that this management method has no longer way to be. Indeed, the player will realize that this kind of management is repetitive and boring. And most of all, he will have a lot of difficulties to cope with `change`. In short, it's not fun at all...

Once the player will realize it, we invite him to learn about the Agile Methodologies, where the developers can bring their own values to the project, and where they are not just like machines who can produce any code without thinking.

With this game, we want to `change` the IT leaders' mentality, and why not of the entire world !
